# Cogs-18-Final-Project
Sorry, about not finishing the project. I spent over 15 hours on it learning python syntax and debugging.

These projects only use basic modules, time, tkinter, random, and turtle.
First compile the MakesGame file then run the jupiter notebooks.
The test file only checks if functions are runnable and tuples are tuples.
