# Cogs-18-Final-Project
Unfinished project. Tried to make a Simongame within a day. This was my best attempt.

These projects only use basic modules, time, tkinter, random, and turtle.
First compile the MakesGame file then run the jupiter notebooks.
The test file only checks if functions are runnable and tuples are tuples.
